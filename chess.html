<p> I first learned to play chess from my brother when I was in grade 2. However, I didn't start taking chess seriously until
    I entered high school. Since then, I have participated in several team tournaments, and have received a number of awards including first place at the TSSCL
    chess tournament and ranked as the 5th 12th grader in the OHSCC tournament.
</p>

<p>Here are some resources/advice that may help. I'm not too good myself but I know a lot of friends good at chess
    and here are things they did to become good, in order. (None are surprising)
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Play lots of practice games</li>
    <li>Do tactics on chess.com, lichess, chesstempo</li>
    <li>Become an expert in a few openings</li>
    <li>Play in tournaments</li>
    <li>Read books. Some good ones are:
        <ul>
            <li>My 60 Most Memorable Games by Bobby Fischer</li>
            <li>Some book about endgames by Capablanca</li>
            <li>Garry Kasparov on...</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>My website is currently under development. Please <a href="contact.html">let me know</a> if you have any suggestions!</p>
